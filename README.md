# Graph Conjectures ‚Äì Project Repository

This repository hosts code and results from our research projects focused on Reinforcement Learning and graph theory conjectures.

Each project is organized in a dedicated subdirectory as described below, and includes its own codebase, and experimental results.

## üìÅ Project Directories

- [`A_Systematization_of_the_Wagner_Framework/`](./A_Systematization_of_the_Wagner_Framework/):  
  Code and experiments for the paper *"A Systematization of the Wagner Framework: Graph Theory Conjectures and Reinforcement Learning"*.

- [`Analyzing_RL_Components_Brouwer_Conjecture/`](./Analyzing_RL_Components_Brouwer_Conjecture/):  
  Code and experiments for the paper *"Analyzing RL Components for Wagner‚Äôs Framework via Brouwer‚Äôs Conjecture"*.

Each directory contains a specific `README.md` with detailed information about the project structure, methodology, and usage instructions.
